NFT Leaderboard and Giveaway
Background

The project aims to create a leaderboard and giveaway mechanism for Ible City NFT holders. The application monitors NFT transactions on various blockchains (Algorand, Ethereum, Polygon, and VeChain) and keeps track of the total value of each user's NFTs. Users are rewarded with additional NFTs based on their position in the leaderboard.
Design of the Solution

The solution consists of several components:

    main.py: The main script that initializes the leaderboard, asset watchers, and NFT withdrawal manager.
    leaderboard.py: Handles the leaderboard logic, including updating user values and sorting users based on their total NFT value.
    asset_watchers.py: Monitors NFT transactions on different blockchains (Algorand, Ethereum, Polygon, and VeChain) and updates the leaderboard accordingly.
    nft_withdrawal_manager.py: Manages the giveaway and distribution of NFTs to users.
    user.py: Manages user information, including their associated blockchain addresses, total NFT value, and claimed prizes.

Connections Between Components

    main.py initializes the leaderboard, asset watchers, and NFT withdrawal manager, and starts the asset watchers to monitor NFT transactions.
    asset_watchers.py watches for NFT deposits into the designated holding accounts and updates the user's value in the leaderboard accordingly.
    leaderboard.py keeps track of user values and sorts them based on their total NFT value.
    nft_withdrawal_manager.py checks the leaderboard for giveaway milestones and distributes the appropriate NFT prizes to the winners.
    user.py stores and manages user information, including their total NFT value, prizes, and associated blockchain addresses.

Completing the Project and Launching the Application

To complete the project, you'll need to:

    Set up the necessary blockchain APIs and SDKs to interact with Algorand, Ethereum, Polygon, and VeChain networks.
    Implement the monitoring and transaction handling logic for each blockchain in the respective classes in asset_watchers.py.
    Create a database or another form of persistent storage to store user information, NFT transactions, and giveaway records.
    Implement the user interface to allow users to view the leaderboard, connect their blockchain addresses, and claim their NFT prizes.
    Test the application thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly and securely.

Map Time Limit

The application will have a time when the rankings will close. When the time is reached the ranks are set. Users can still pass NFTs into the holding accounts to claim land but their rank will be set. Rank determines the order in which they will enter the map and claim land. Rank also determines if they receive a Governor NFT on Algorand. This award will happen at the time the rankings close. The reward for these governor NFTs are as follows:

When the map closes, we will send a special Governance City Block to the highest ranking users according the the outline below.

Rank #1 to rank #8 receive a Diamond City Block and are part of the High Council
Rank #9 to rank #38 receive a Gold City Block and are part of the Senate
Rank #39 to rank #118 receive a Silver City Block and are part of the General Assembly

We need to show the user how many Ible City NFTs and Ible City Block NFTs are needed to reach each level of governance using the same modulo 70 routine that we did for the next closest rank calculation.

Requirements

2) Determine if the core requirements listed below are implemented
(2a) Manage users by their unique_code
(2b) Allow users to connect their blockchain wallet from the Algorand, Ethereum, Polygon, or VeChain blockchains to prove ownership of a blockchain account
(2c) Record ownership of the blockchain account in the database, attributing it to the unique_code
(2d) Allow the user to select a blockchain to deposit NFT assets listed in our code to special holding accounts on the Algorand, Ethereum, Polygon, or VeChain blockchains owned by the application. Ensure that the user has connected at least one blockchain account and attributed it to the database before proceeding to showing them the holding account where they will send the assets
(2e) Have the user select the asset type and amount in the account they have connected to send to the holding account
(2f) Once they have selected the account, type, and amount of NFTs build the transaction for the user. Note that the user can select more than one type of asset to send to the holding account if it is on the same blockchain (example: The user has 3 Ible City Series I and 4 Ible City Series III NFTs on the Algorand blockchain - allow them to select all of both these assets to transfer to the Algorand holding account)
(2g) Present the transaction to the user so that they can sign for the transaction in their wallet - note this is accomplished since the user has already connected their wallet. The wallet connections for each blockchain are Algorand (Pera Wallet Connection, Defly Wallet Connection, WalletConnect), Ethereum (Metamask, WalletConnect), Polygon (Metamask, WalletConnect), and VeChain (Sync2, Sync with VeChain Thor)
(2h) Monitor for the transaction to the holding accounts on each chain and, when a transaction occurs, note the sender account and update the user table with the appropriate value given the transfer of NFTs
(2i) Create a leaderboard where we keep track of each users total value deposited into the holding accounts on all blockchains
(2j) Present the confirmed assets deposited to the user along with the transaction ID
(2k) Present the current rank of the user based on the value of the NFTs they have deposited into the holding accounts
(2l) Present the amount of NFTs the user would need to deposit to reach the next highest level using the modulo 70 formula
(2m) Display whether the user is eligible for a governance NFT based on their current rank and, if so, what NFT they will receive when the time to confirm the rankings is reached
(2n) Display the minimum amount of NFTs needed to receive a Silver, Gold, or Diamond governance NFT based on the users current holdings. Use the modulo 70 calculation for this as well. If the user is already eligible for a governance NFT, only show the level above where they are (example: if they are already eligible for a Gold governance NFT, only show them the amount of NFTs they need to transfer to a holding account(s) in order to receive a diamond governance NFT instead)
(2o) When the date and time is met for the ranking to enter the map, lock and confirm each users rank in the database connected to their unique code. Allow the developers to set this date and time after the application is launched (it does not have to be set when first launched)
(2p) When the date and time is met for the ranking to enter the map, automatically award the governance NFTs that are being distributed according to rank in the application. Ensure that the distribution happens according to the table and that there is only one of these awarded to each unique_code for the top 118 users on the leaderboard.
(2q) Run the Ible City governance block NFT giveaway where a prize is drawn for every 5,000 NFTs deposited (the milestones) based on the giveaway table laid out previously. This is not tied to the rank or time lock previously described but is it’s own initiative.
(2r) Ensure that, if the number of Ible City Blocks goes below a milestone previously hit due to withdrawals, we do not accidentally award a prize again for a milestone that has already been met
(2s) Pick the winner as soon as a milestone is reached and record it in the database. Ensure that each Ible City Block NFT deposited acts as a ticket for the drawing and that users can win multiple times, even with the same ticket. This contest is not tied to the countdown/rank process outlined earlier and is totally dependent upon the number of Ible City Block NFTs deposited into the holding accounts.
(2t) Make a notation in the user database for a user when they win a prize. Ensure that a user can win multiple prizes before claiming a prize
(2u) Ensure when a user that has won a prize enters the application, that a notification prompts them to select one of their Algorand accounts in the database to receive the governance NFT giveaway prize
(2v) Ensure that, if the user does not have an Algorand account registered in the database, that they first must connect an Algorand wallet and confirm an account, written to the database, before the prize is distributed.
(2w) Once the user confirms the Algorand account to win the prize by connecting the correct account, build a transaction and send the NFT prize or prizes to the recipient
(2x) Allow for users to withdraw NFTs by first connecting an account that they have previously used to send NFTs to a holding account. This account must be present in the database for the user’s unique_code. Once confirmed, they select the type of NFT and amount of NFTs they want to receive back from the holding account. We build the transaction and send it back to the originating account. Please ensure that we do not send more NFTs than the user currently has credit for that particular blockchain and account (we must check the database)
(2y) Update the database when a withdrawal request is completed to ensure that the count, type, number of NFTs, and value are all updated for accuracy


Notes on project

Before the cutoff, we want to give people the ability to pull their claims out the holding accounts. The application holds the keys to all of the holding accounts so, when a request for return of NFTs is made, the application can build a transaction and send to the appropriate network to return the NFTs to the account from which it was sent. The user must first connect their wallet to the application to confirm ownership of the sender account and specify the type and number of NFTs they wish to have returned. We must then check to ensure this account has that number of NFTs present in the chosen holding account prior to building the transaction.

The governance Ible City Block NFTs are all on the Algorand blockchain

Diamond City Block:  ASA ID 1079869388
Gold City Block: ASA ID 1079870494
Silver City Block: ASA ID 1079871282

the leaderboard is based solely on the value of the NFTs deposited into the holding account(s) on Algorand, Ethereum, Polygon, and VeChain from our original table below. The reward of governance NFTs when the time lock occurs for ranking is also based on the rank derived from the total value of each user's NFTs deposited into the holding account(s).  The reward structure is also posted below for reference.

Governance City Block NFT reward distribution when the date/time lock are met in the application

dmbrought@protonmail.com
The current rank we have developed determines when the user enters the map.
It also determines whether the user will be a governor in our virtual land.
The first way someone can become a governor is by their rank.
When the map closes, we will send a special Governance City Block to the highest ranking users according the the outline below.

Rank #1 to rank #8 receive a Diamond City Block and are part of the High Council
Rank #9 to rank #38 receive a Gold City Block and are part of the Senate
Rank #39 to rank #118 receive a Silver City Block and are part of the General Assembly

We want to display the current rank to the user. We also want to show them how many additional NFTs they would need to send to the holding account(s) in order to move to the next highest rank. 

We want to give the user the simplest way to achieve this goal so we will use a modulo calculator in order to achieve this calculation. Since an Ible City NFT has a value of 70 and an Ible City Block NFT has a value of 1, we can use the modulo calculation a mod b = ? to find the correct combination of NFTs where b is 70.

Example:

The current user has 5 Ible City NFTs and 20 Ible City Block NFTs
5 Ible City NFts (each with a value of 70) = 350
20 Ible City Block NFTs (each with a value of 1) = 20
so the user's current total value of NFTs sent to the holding account(s) = 370
and the user's current rank is #340

The next highest rank is #339 and the value held by the user with rank #339 is 450
This means the current user needs to send enough NFTs to reach a value of 451
The total value needed to reach this goal is (450-370) + 1 = 81

Using mod 70 we have 81 mod 70 = 1 R11
So we can let the current user know that they can send in 
1 Ible City NFT and 11 Ible City Block NFTs to reach the next rank

I need you to determine the best course of action to implement this code and then implement the code as lead programmer.

We now want to ensure that, if a user wants to withdraw their NFTs from the holding account(s). For the UX, the user can click a button to initiate a return of assets to the originating account. They must select which network and then the address they previously confirmed as their account. They must then connect their wallet again to confirm ownership of that account. They then select the amount and type of NFTs they wish to return (which series and amount for the selected network) They then confirm their desire to have these returned From this point, as owner of the application and the possessor of the private keys for the holding account(s), we will build a transaction and submit this to the proper blockchain network to return the selected type and number of NFTs to the user. This must not exceed what was originally sent by the selected account address. As lead programmer, please review the requirements above and write the code necessary to implement this function.




We have one more feature to account for in our project. There is a giveaway running concurrently with the ranking but they are not connected. The giveaway could end before or after the time lock happens for the map ranking. The giveaway is not time dependent but rather dependent upon the locking of Ible City Blocks.
