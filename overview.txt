NFT Leaderboard and Giveaway
Background

The project aims to create a leaderboard and giveaway mechanism for Ible City NFT holders. The application monitors NFT transactions on various blockchains (Algorand, Ethereum, Polygon, and VeChain) and keeps track of the total value of each user's NFTs. Users are rewarded with additional NFTs based on their position in the leaderboard.
Design of the Solution

The solution consists of several components:

    main.py: The main script that initializes the leaderboard, asset watchers, and NFT withdrawal manager.
    leaderboard.py: Handles the leaderboard logic, including updating user values and sorting users based on their total NFT value.
    asset_watchers.py: Monitors NFT transactions on different blockchains (Algorand, Ethereum, Polygon, and VeChain) and updates the leaderboard accordingly.
    nft_withdrawal_manager.py: Manages the giveaway and distribution of NFTs to users.
    user.py: Manages user information, including their associated blockchain addresses, total NFT value, and claimed prizes.

Connections Between Components

    main.py initializes the leaderboard, asset watchers, and NFT withdrawal manager, and starts the asset watchers to monitor NFT transactions.
    asset_watchers.py watches for NFT deposits into the designated holding accounts and updates the user's value in the leaderboard accordingly.
    leaderboard.py keeps track of user values and sorts them based on their total NFT value.
    nft_withdrawal_manager.py checks the leaderboard for giveaway milestones and distributes the appropriate NFT prizes to the winners.
    user.py stores and manages user information, including their total NFT value, prizes, and associated blockchain addresses.

Completing the Project and Launching the Application

To complete the project, you'll need to:

    Set up the necessary blockchain APIs and SDKs to interact with Algorand, Ethereum, Polygon, and VeChain networks.
    Implement the monitoring and transaction handling logic for each blockchain in the respective classes in asset_watchers.py.
    Create a database or another form of persistent storage to store user information, NFT transactions, and giveaway records.
    Implement the user interface to allow users to view the leaderboard, connect their blockchain addresses, and claim their NFT prizes.
    Test the application thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly and securely.

Potential Improvements

    Add support for more blockchains and NFT platforms to broaden the application's reach and user base.
    Implement a more sophisticated prize distribution mechanism, such as tiered rewards or time-limited giveaways.
    Enhance the user interface with real-time updates, notifications, and rich visualizations of the leaderboard and user holdings.
    Integrate with social media platforms to allow users to share their achievements and encourage further participation in the NFT ecosystem.

Other Notes

This readme file provides a high-level overview of the Ible City NFT Leaderboard and Giveaway project. When implementing the application, pay close attention to the individual components and their connections, and ensure that the system is secure and reliable. The code snippets provided in this conversation are meant as starting points for building the full solution, and further development and testing are required to create a complete and functioning application.
